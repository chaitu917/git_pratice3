Java is a popular procedural and object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1995 and it is owned by oracle.

Java is secure ,fast and powerful programming language. Java works on different platforms likes windows,mac,linux...

Java can be used for mobile applicatons , web based and desktop applications and server based applications.

HELLO WORLD PROGRAM IN JAVA:
  class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}

In java programming language that incorporates the concept of object-oriented programming to the fullest.

AIRTHMETIC OPERATIONS IN JAVA:
1)Addition(+) this sign gives the sum of the two numbers.
EXample;
class Addition {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(2 + 5);
        System.out.println(1 + 1.5);
    }
}

2) Subtraction (-) this sign gives the difference between the two numbers.

class Subtraction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5 - 2);
    }
}

3)Multiplication (*) this sign gives the product of the two numbers.
class Multiplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5 * 2);
        System.out.println(5 * 0.5);
    }
}

4) Division (/) it returns the quotient as a result

class Division {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5 / 2);
        System.out.println(4 / 2);
    }
}

5) Modulo operation (%) it returns the remainder as a result.
class Modulus {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(5 % 2);
        System.out.println(4 % 2);
    }
}

VARIABLES:
Variables are like containers for storing information.

A variable is created when it is declared , and to declare a variable, we must specify the type of data first, followed by the variable.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       int points;  // Declaration
       points = 90;  // Initialization
       int totalPoints = 100;  // Definition

       System.out.println(points);
       System.out.println(totalPoints);
    }
}

Note: Java programming language is a atatically typed language, we cannot change the type of the variable once it is declared..

in java variables can be reassigned like this
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 1;
        System.out.println(a);
        a = 2;
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}

The final variable cannot be reassigned.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int SPEED_LIMIT = 60;
        System.out.println(SPEED_LIMIT);
    }
}

BODMAS: the standard order of evaluting an expression.

In java statements are terminated with the semi-colon(;).

In java , ablock of code is enclosed between balanced brackets({}).

Comments :
* single line comments are started with //
* Multi line comments are started with /* */.


Data types:
 in programming language , every value has an associated type is known as datatype.They are two types 

1)Primitive data types are those that are predefined by the programming language (Java).
1= Boolean in general anything that can take one of two possible values is considered as Boolean.

2=Char this type of data type is used to store a single character char alphabet = 'A';

3= Byte data type is used to store integers without any fractional part.It is used to store small values,the range is -128 to 127.byte points = 100;

4=The short data type is used to store integers without any fractional part. It is used to store values that are bigger than a byte. The range of values is -32,768 to 32,767.short number = 28745;

5=The int data type is used to store integers without any fractional part. It is used to store values that are bigger than short. The range of values is -231 to 231-1.int distance = 2036372;

6=The long data type is used to store large integers without any fractional part. It is used to store values that are bigger than int. The range of values is -263 to 263-1

The long values should contain the suffix 'l' or 'L'
long area = 203637254L;


7=The float data type is used to store any number with a decimal point. The float data type stores a value up to 7-point precision (ex: 12.1234567). Hence, it is used when less precision is required.

The float values should contain the suffix 'f' or 'F'
float height = 5.10f;

8=The double data type is used to store any number with a decimal point. The double data type stores a value up to 16-point precision. Hence, it is used when more precision is required.

The double values may contain the suffix 'd' or 'D'
double length = 5.112;
double breadth = 9.2345D;

These data types are used to store multiple values. Non-primitive data types are defined by the programmer.


String

The String data type is simply a sequence of characters. For example, "Rahul" is a string that consists of the characters 'R', 'a', 'h', 'u', and 'l'.

In Java, double quotes (") are used to represent a string.

String name = "Rahul";
Possible Mistake

Double quotes (") are used to represent a string in Java. Using single quotes (') for strings results in an error.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Rahul";
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}

1.PACKAGES:

In Java, a package is a group of related classes, sub-packages, etc. Packages can be conceptually compared to different folders (also called directories) on your computer.

The package consists of re-usable code, which eliminates the need for the programmer to write the same code several times.

Java provides a number of built-in packages. For example,

java.lang
java.util
java.net, etc.
To utilize a package or a specific class, we need to use import keyword.
import java.util.*;

Using an asterisk (*) imports a whole package along with all the classes contained within.

Java also gives us the option of importing a specific class from a package based on our requirements.

The below statement imports the Scanner class from the java.util package.
import java.util.Scanner;

The Scanner class in the package java.util is used to read user input.

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        String username = input.nextLine();

        System.out.println(username);
        input.close();  // closing Scanner object
    }
}

Here, calling new Scanner() will return an object and it is assigned to the variable named input

The System.in parameter is used to read input from the standard input (i.e., keyboard).

nextLine() method is used to read a String value till the end of line.

Calling input.close(), closes the Scanner object input. We cannot read the user input once it is closed.

It is a good programming practice to explicitly close the Scanner using the close() method once you are done using it.


Summary
import keyword is used to import packages in Java.
Scanner class is used to read input from the user and it provides different methods for taking different input types from the user.
print() and the println() methods are used to print output to the console.
print() function prints in the same line whereas, println() function goes to new line after printing.




nextInt()	Reads an int value
nextLong()	Reads a long value
nextFloat()	Reads a float value
nextBoolean()	Reads a boolean value
next()	Reads a String value only until a space(" ") is encountered
nextLine()	Reads a String value till the end of line
nextDouble()	Reads a double value
nextShort()	Reads a short value
nextByte()	Reads a byte value

We can also check tnhe data type of the variable or value by calling getClass().getSimpleName() method.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String username = "Ravi";
        System.out.println(username.getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
}
o/p is String

we can convert primitive data type into an object using OBJECT keyeword
System.out.println((Object)age)getClass().getSimpleName());


TYPE CONVERSION:-
  It is a process of converting the value of one data type into another data type

1)Java compiler automatically convert one data type into another datatype is called Implicit type conversion.

char -> byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double -> boolean -> String

If an expression contains values of more than one data type, the lower data type values will be converted to a higher data type.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int value1 = 4;
        long value2 = 5L;
        System.out.println(((Object) (value1 + value2)).getClass().getSimpleName());
    }
}

2) Programmers change the data type of a value to the desired data type is called Explicit type conversion.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long x = 10L;
        float y = (float) x;
        System.out.println(y);
    }
}

Conversion using methods
String.valueOf(): converts any primitive data type into a string.
Integer.parseInt(): convert String to int data type.
Character.getNumericValue(): converts char to int data type.
Character.forDigit(): converts int to char.
Double.parseDouble(str): convert String to double data type.
Float.parseFloat(str): convert String to float data type.


STRING METHODS:- String is a sequence of characters.

In java strings are objects of a class called String.
1)string concatenation= It involves joining teo or more strings together to create a new string.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Hello ";
        String str2 = "World";
        String concatenatedString = str1.concat(str2);

        System.out.println(concatenatedString);
    }
}

We can also use + operator to concatenation strings.Multiple values of any primitive datatype can be concatenated with a string using + operator.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str1 = "Hello ";
        String str2 = "World ";
        int value = 3;
        String concatenatedString = str1 + str2 + value;

        System.out.println(concatenatedString);
    }
}


2) LENGTH OF THE STRING:-
the string object has a length() method that returns the number of characters in a given string.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Rahul";
        int stringLength = name.length();

        System.out.println(stringLength);
    }
}

3)STRING INDEXING:-
 WE can acess an individual character in a string using their positions which start fronm 0.These positions are also called indexes.
The charAt() method is used to get the character at a specified index in a string.
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "Rahul";
        char firstLetter = name.charAt(0);

        System.out.println(firstLetter);
    }
}


4) STRING SLICING:-
 Obtaining a part of a string is called string slicing.
THE substring() method is used to access a part of the string.

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String message = "Welcome to Java";
        String part = message.substring(0, 5);

        System.out.println(part);
    }
}


5)STRING REPETITION:-
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Rahul";

        System.out.println(str.repeat(2));
    }
}
